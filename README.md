## Goal                                 [![PyPI Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/share-df.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/share-df/)

This package enables cross-collaboration between nontechnical and technical contributors by allowing developers to generate a URL for free with one line of code that they can then send to nontechnical contributors enabling them to modify the dataframe with a web app. Then, they can send it back to the developer, directly generating the modified dataframe, maintaining code continuity, and removing the burden of file transfer and conversion to other file formats.

## Technical Contributor Features
- ```pip install share-df``` 
- one function call to generate a link to send, accessible anywhere 
- changes made by the client are received back as a dataframe for seamless development 
  
## Nontechnical Contributor Features
- Easy Google OAuth login 
- Seamless UI to modify the dataframe 
    * Change column names
    * Drag around columns
    * Change all values
    * Rename columns
    * Add new columns and rows
- Send the results back with the click of a button

## How to Run
1. ```pip install share-df```
2. If you do not already have one, generate an auth token for free in less than a minute with [ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/)
3. Create a .env file in your directory with NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=<insert your token>
4. import and call the function on any df!

## Example Code
```
import pandas as pd
from share_df import pandaBear

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Name': ['John', 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol'],
    'City': ['New York', 'London', 'Paris', 'Tokyo'],
    'Salary': [50000, 60000, 75000, 65000]
})

df = pandaBear(df)
print(df)
```

## Google Collab
- This code works by creating a localhost and then tunneling traffic to make it accessible to other people.
- Thereby, since Google Collab code runs on a VM this is an interesting challenge to handle.
- As of 0.1.7 the package offers experimental support for creating a Google-generated link for DFs but this link is not shareable and the behavior is currently unstable for editing the dataframe.
- For Google Collab instead of using a .env I recommend putting your NGROK_AUTHTOKEN into the Google Collab secrets manager (key icon on the left side of the screen). That way your secrets also can be synced to other notebooks and you don't have to repeat the .env uploading each time.

## Future Functionality
- True Asynchronicity with ipyparallel
- Code Recreation (instead of overwriting the df just solve the code needed)
- First-class Google Collab support
- Multiple authenticated users
